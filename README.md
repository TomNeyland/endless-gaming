## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TomNeyland/endless-gaming.git
cd endless-gaming

# Start data collection (first 5000 games)
docker-compose run --rm endless-gaming \
  python scripts/collect_games.py collect --max-pages 5

# Check collection status
docker-compose run --rm endless-gaming \
  python scripts/collect_games.py status
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install
poetry shell

# Initialize database
python scripts/setup_db.py

# Start collecting game data
python scripts/collect_games.py collect --max-pages 2

# Run tests
pytest
```

## 📊 Data Collection

The heart of Endless Gaming is a robust data collection system that gathers comprehensive game information:

```bash
# Collect games by popularity (most played first)
python scripts/collect_games.py collect --max-pages 10

# Update metadata for existing games only  
python scripts/collect_games.py collect --update-metadata

# View current database statistics
python scripts/collect_games.py status
```

### What Gets Collected

- **Game Metadata**: Name, developer, publisher, release date
- **Player Statistics**: Owner estimates, player counts, review scores
- **Categorization**: Steam tags with vote counts, genres, features
- **Pricing**: Current price, historical data, regional pricing
- **Reviews**: Positive/negative ratios, recent trends

### Live Progress Tracking

Watch as games are processed in real-time:

```
✅ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (FPS, Shooter, Multiplayer)
✅ Apex Legends (Free to Play, Battle Royale, Multiplayer)  
✅ PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS (Survival, Shooter, Battle Royale)
✅ Palworld (Open World, Survival, Creature Collector)
```

## 🐳 Deployment

### Production Deployment

```bash
# With PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
docker-compose --profile production up -d postgres

# Initialize database
docker-compose run --rm endless-gaming python scripts/setup_db.py

# Start data collection  
docker-compose --profile production up endless-gaming
```

### Configuration

Environment variables for production:

```bash
