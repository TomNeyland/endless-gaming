# Testing Auto-Navigation Feature

## How to Test Vote Persistence and Auto-Navigation

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (F12) to see the debug logging

3. **Test Scenario 1: Fresh User**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
   - Should show the game picker comparison UI
   - Make at least 5 votes by choosing games
   - Check console for localStorage save messages like: `ðŸ”„ Successfully loaded X votes from localStorage`

4. **Test Scenario 2: Auto-Navigation**
   - After making 5+ votes, refresh the page or navigate to `http://localhost:4200/game-picker`
   - Should automatically redirect to `http://localhost:4200/recommendations`
   - Should show your personalized game recommendations
   - Check console for auto-navigation messages

5. **Test Scenario 3: Direct Recommendations Access**
   - Navigate directly to `http://localhost:4200/recommendations`
   - If you have 5+ votes: should show recommendations
   - If you have <5 votes: should redirect to game-picker

6. **Test Scenario 4: Filter Reset with Start Over**
   - Apply some filters (search text, price filters, tag filters, etc.)
   - Make some votes to establish preferences
   - Click any "Reset" or "Start Over" buttons in the UI
   - Should clear localStorage and navigate back to game-picker
   - Should start fresh with no saved preferences
   - **Should reset all filters to their default values**

7. **Test Scenario 5: Complete Reset Verification**
   - After clicking "Start Over", verify:
     - URL is `/game-picker`
     - No preference tags are displayed
     - All filters are cleared (search box empty, no active filter chips)
     - Comparison count is 0
     - localStorage is cleared

## Expected Console Output

When working correctly, you should see logs like:
```
ðŸ”„ Loading from localStorage: Data found
ðŸ”„ Successfully loaded 8 votes from localStorage
ðŸŽ® GamePickerPage: Auto-navigation check:
  - Current URL: /game-picker
  - Comparison count: 8
  - Has minimum votes (5+): true
ðŸŽ® GamePickerPage: Auto-navigating to recommendations due to existing votes
```

**When resetting, you should see:**
```
ðŸ”„ Resetting game picker - clearing all state
ðŸ”„ GameFilterService: Resetting filters to defaults
ðŸ”„ GameFilterService: Cleared auto-saved filter state
ðŸ”„ All services reset to defaults
```

## Troubleshooting

If auto-navigation isn't working:
1. Check console for localStorage loading messages
2. Verify comparison count is correctly loaded
3. Check that URL routing is working (should see URL change to `/recommendations`)
4. Clear localStorage manually: `localStorage.removeItem('endless-gaming-preferences')`
